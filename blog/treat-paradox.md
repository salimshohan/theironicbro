There is a universal law in friendship: **The less money you have, the more your friends will ask for a treat.**

It is a paradox. When I have money, nobody is hungry. But the moment my bank balance hits zero, suddenly everyone wants a feast.

Here is the tragic story of the **"Give Us a Treat"** culture.

## 📉 The Empty Pocket Reality

It is the end of the month. You check your pocket.
You find a crumpled bill and a button that fell off your shirt.
This is your net worth.

Suddenly, your friend approaches you with a smile. You know that smile. It is the smile of a predator looking at prey.

**Friend:** "Hey bro, congratulations!"
**You:** "For what?"
**Friend:** "You breathed today. Your treat."

## 🎂 The "Treat" Triggers

Friends don't need a valid reason to ask for food. Anything can be a reason:

1.  **Birthday:** Valid reason. (But why do *I* have to pay for *my* birth? I didn't even ask to be born).
2.  **New Phone:** "Your treat."
3.  **Passed Exam:** "Your treat."
4.  **Failed Exam:** "Sad treat."
5.  **New Haircut:** "Nice cut. Your treat."

Basically, if you exist, you owe them food.

## 🎭 The Art of Dodging the Bill

When you are broke, you become an actor worthy of an Oscar. Here are the top excuses we all use:

### 1. The "Wallet Amnesia"
> "Oh no! I left my wallet on the table! I swear I took it... wait, did I?"
*(Acting level: 10/10)*

### 2. The "Server Down"
> "Bro, I would pay via the app, but the server is down. Look, it's loading..."
*(You deliberately turned off your mobile data).*

### 3. The "Fasting" Lie
> "I am fasting today. Not religious fasting, just... intermittent fasting for health."
*(Stomach growls loudly).*

## 🧾 The Bill Arrival Trauma

Eventually, you fail to escape. You go to a restaurant. You order the cheapest snack on the menu. Your friends order the "Special Chicken Platter."

The waiter brings the bill.
The table goes silent.
Everyone suddenly becomes very interested in the ceiling fan or their phone screens.

**The Rule:** The person who makes eye contact with the waiter first has to pay.
You stare at your shoes.

## 🏁 Conclusion

To my dear friends,
I love you. But I love my kidney more. Please stop asking for treats.
Let's normalize **"Go Dutch"** (Everyone pays for themselves).

Until then, I will be hiding in my room with my empty wallet and a packet of dry biscuits.

**Status:** *Offline.*
