When we were kids, we couldn't wait to grow up.
We thought adults had it all: No homework, eating ice cream for dinner, and buying whatever we wanted.

We were wrong. We were so wrong.

Adulthood is not freedom. Adulthood is just googling *"how to boil an egg"* and wondering why cheese is so expensive.
I would like to cancel my subscription to Adulthood. I did not read the Terms and Conditions properly.

Here is why Adulting is the biggest scam in history.

## 💸 The Mystery of the Disappearing Money

As a kid, 100 Taka felt like a fortune. You could buy the world.
As an adult, you walk out of the house, breathe some fresh air, and suddenly 500 Taka is gone.

* **Electricity Bill:** Expensive.
* **Internet Bill:** Necessary but painful.
* **Groceries:** Why is cooking oil gold now?

You get your salary. You feel rich for exactly 5 minutes. Then you pay your bills. Now you are poor again until next month. It is a vicious cycle.

## 🦴 The Random Body Pains

Remember when you could fall out of a tree and just stand up laughing?
Now, if I sleep in a slightly wrong position, my neck hurts for 3 business days.

* **Knee Pain:** Check.
* **Back Pain:** Always.
* **Tiredness:** Permanent.

I make noises when I sit down (*"Ughhh"*) and noises when I stand up (*"Ahhh"*). I have become my grandfather.

## 📞 The Phone Call Anxiety

As a kid, running to answer the phone was exciting.
As an adult, when the phone rings, I stare at it with pure terror.

* **Unknown Number:** "Please don't be a scammer, please don't be the bank."
* **Known Number:** "What do they want? Why couldn't they just text?"

My favorite hobby is watching the phone ring until it stops, then texting: *"Sorry, missed your call. What's up?"*

## 🧹 The Never-Ending Cleaning

No one told me that 80% of adulthood is just cleaning things that you just cleaned yesterday.

* You wash the dishes. You eat. **More dishes.**
* You do the laundry. You wear clothes. **More laundry.**
* You sweep the floor. You blink. **Dust is back.**

It is a war you cannot win. The dust always wins.

## 🏁 Conclusion

If any children are reading this: **Stay in school.** Don't grow up. It’s a trap.
Enjoy your nap times. Enjoy your free food.

I am going to go take a nap now, but first, I have to take a painkiller for my back.

**Current Status:** Resignation letter drafted.
