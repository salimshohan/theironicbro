There is a magical time zone that exists in every student's mind. It is called **"Later"**.
* "I'll study later."
* "I'll wash the dishes later."
* "I'll fix my life later."

But scientists have confirmed that "Later" is not a time. It is a lie. It is a trap. It is the beginning of the end.

Here is the timeline of the "I'll Do It Later" cycle.

## 🕒 Phase 1: The Delusion (2:00 PM)

You have an assignment due tomorrow. It takes 2 hours to finish. You have 10 hours left.
**Brain:** "Bro, relax. You have plenty of time. Watch one episode of that show."
**You:** "You are right. I deserve a break."

*Result: You watch 4 seasons.*

## 🕕 Phase 2: The False Promise (6:00 PM)

You realize 4 hours have passed.
**Brain:** "Okay, seriously now. We start at exactly 7:00 PM. Sharp."
**You:** "Yes. 7:00 PM. New me. Productive me."

At 7:01 PM, you look at the clock.
**You:** "Oh no, it's 7:01. I missed the start time. I guess I have to wait until 8:00 PM now."

## 🕙 Phase 3: The Panic (11:00 PM)

The deadline is close. The guilt is kicking in.
But suddenly, your room looks dirty.
**You:** "I cannot study in a messy room!"

You proceed to clean your entire room, organize your bookshelf by color, and wash your bedsheets.
You have done everything *except* the actual assignment. This is called **"Productive Procrastination"**.

## 🕑 Phase 4: The Surrender (2:00 AM)

You are tired. Your eyes are burning. You have written 3 words: *"The assignment is..."*
**Brain:** "You know what? Sleep now. Wake up early at 5 AM and finish it. The morning mind is fresh."

We all know how this story ends.
**Spoiler Alert:** You wake up at 10 AM.

## 🏁 Conclusion

"Later" is a mythical land where we are all fit, rich, and productive.
But in reality, we are just lying on the couch scrolling through reels about how to stop procrastinating.

**Current Status:** I will finish this article later.
