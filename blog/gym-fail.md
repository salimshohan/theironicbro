We all have that moment. Usually at 2 AM while eating chips.
We look in the mirror and say: *"That's it. I am changing my life. I will become The Rock. I will have abs of steel."*

So, we buy the expensive shoes, the neon protein shaker, and the yearly membership.
We are motivated. We are ready.
And then... reality hits.

Here is the timeline of the "New Me" gym journey.

---

## 🤩 Day 1: The Confidence (The Rock Era)

You walk into the gym like you own the place.
You put on your headphones. You play "Eye of the Tiger."
**Brain:** "Look at those heavy weights. Pick them up."

You lift things that are way too heavy for you. You run on the treadmill at speed 12. You do 500 crunches.
You leave the gym sweating, feeling like a Greek God.
**You:** "This is easy! I'm coming back tomorrow at 5 AM!"

## 😫 Day 2: The Paralysis (The Penguin Era)

You wake up the next morning. You try to sit up.
**ERROR 404: ABS NOT FOUND.**
Actually, your abs are there, but they are screaming.

Every muscle in your body hurts.
* **Walking:** You walk like a penguin waddling on ice.
* **Stairs:** The enemy. You have to go down sideways while crying.
* **Sitting on the toilet:** The ultimate challenge. You have to free-fall for the last 5 inches because your legs refuse to bend.

You decide to skip the gym today. "It's a recovery day," you lie to yourself.

## 🍔 Day 3: The Negotiation (The Pizza Era)

The soreness is slightly better, but the motivation is fading.
**Brain:** "You worked out really hard on Day 1. You burned like 300 calories."
**You:** "Yeah!"
**Brain:** "So, technically, you deserve a reward. Like a burger. Or two."

You eat the burger. You feel guilty.
**You:** "I'll just burn it off tomorrow." (Spoiler: You won't).

## 💸 Day 30: The Donation

Fast forward one month.
You haven't been to the gym in 27 days.
But you are still paying for the membership.

Every month, the gym deducts money from your account. It is no longer a membership; it is a **Charitable Donation**.
You are basically sponsoring the fit people to get fit. You are a philanthropist.

## 🥤 The Protein Powder Decoration

And let's not forget the giant tub of "Chocolate Fudge Whey Protein" you bought.
It sits on top of your fridge.
You used one scoop. It tasted like chalk and sadness.
Now it is just expensive kitchen decor. A monument to your failed dreams.

## 🏁 Conclusion

I have accepted my fate. I am built for comfort, not for speed.
I have a "Dad Bod" without being a dad. It's a lifestyle.

**Next Plan:** I will start running. Next Monday. Definitely.
