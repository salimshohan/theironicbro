Humans have achieved incredible things. We have sent people to the moon. We have created Artificial Intelligence. We have the entire knowledge of the world in our pockets.

But for some reason, in the year 2026, we still cannot create a printer that works simply by pressing "Print".

A home printer is not a device. It is a demon sent to test your patience. It sits in the corner, gathering dust, waiting for the one moment you are in a rush—so it can ruin your life.

## 🎨 The "Magenta" Conspiracy

This is the greatest scam in the history of technology.

**You:** "I would like to print this text document. It is just black text on white paper."
**Printer:** "I cannot do that."
**You:** "Why? Do you have black ink?"
**Printer:** "Yes, the black cartridge is full."
**You:** "Great! So print it."
**Printer:** "I cannot. I am out of **Magenta**."

**WHY?!**
Why do you need bright pink ink to print a legal document? Are you mixing the colors to create a 'Premium Black'? It makes no sense.

## 😨 The Sensor of Fear

Printers are sentient. They can smell fear. They know when you are desperate.

* **Scenario A:** You are printing a random meme or a coloring page for fun.
    * **Result:** Prints instantly. Perfect quality. 100 pages a minute.
* **Scenario B:** Your flight leaves in 2 hours. You need to print your boarding pass and visa.
    * **Result:** *Whirr... Click... Kachunk...* **"Paper Jam in Tray 2."**

There is no paper in Tray 2. There never was. It is jamming on air just to watch you panic.

## 📶 The Wireless Connection Myth

"Wireless Printing" is a lie.

**Computer:** "Printer is offline."
**You:** "But it's right there! The light is on! It is connected to the WiFi!"
**Computer:** "I don't see it. Maybe it moved to another country."

You spend 45 minutes restarting the router, reinstalling drivers, and praying to the tech gods.
Eventually, you give up, email the file to yourself, and plug in a USB cable like it's 2005.

## 🔊 The Song of Its People

Why does a printer need to make so much noise before printing one page?

You press print.
**The Printer:** *Whirrrrrr. Click. Clack. Buzz. Vibrate. Screech.*

It sounds like it is assembling a car inside. It does a full system calibration, cleans its print heads, and contemplates the meaning of life for 5 minutes before finally spitting out one sheet of paper.

## 🏁 Conclusion

I have accepted that I will never own a working printer.
The most reliable printer in the world is the one at the local stationery shop down the street. It costs 5 taka per page, but it saves me 5 years of stress.

**Status:** Selling my printer. Or throwing it out the window.
