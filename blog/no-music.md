For introverts and students, earphones are not just an accessory. They are a **Life Support System**.
They are a "Do Not Disturb" sign glued to your ears. They are the shield that protects us from the chaos of the outside world.

But one day, tragedy strikes.
You leave the house. You get on the bus or rickshaw. You reach into your pocket to grab your trusted white wires (or fancy buds).
**Empty.**
You check the other pocket.
**Empty.**

The realization hits you like a truck: **You have to commute in RAW REALITY.**

Here is the horror story of surviving the journey without music.

## 😱 Phase 1: The Panic

The first 5 minutes are just pure denial.
* "Maybe they fell to the bottom of the bag?"
* "Maybe I left them in my jacket?"

You search frantically. People are staring at you because you look like you are fighting invisible ghosts in your backpack.
Eventually, you accept your fate. You are naked. Not physically, but spiritually. The world can now speak to you.

## 🗣️ Phase 2: The Unwanted Podcast

With music, the bus is a music video starring you.
Without music, the bus is a live podcast of other people's problems.

You are forced to listen to conversations you never asked for:
* **The Auntie on the Phone:** Screaming about how her vegetable vendor cheated her of 5 taka.
* **The Cringy Couple:** "No you hang up... No you hang up..." (Please, both of you hang up).
* **The Businessman:** discussing "Million dollar deals" while wearing a torn shirt.

You know too much about their lives now. You cannot unhear it.

## 👀 Phase 3: The Eye Contact Game

When you have earphones in, you can stare blankly at nothing, and it looks cool. You are "vibing."
Without earphones, staring at nothing makes you look like a serial killer.

So you frantically look for safe places to aim your eyes:
1.  **The Floor:** Dirty. Boring.
2.  **The Window:** Okay, but you look sad.
3.  **The Advertisement:** You read the same poster for "Herbal Hair Loss Cure" 45 times. You memorize the phone number. You consider calling them just to pass the time.

Then, you accidentally make eye contact with a stranger.
**Stranger:** *Stares back.*
**You:** *Looks away instantly and pretends to examine your fingernails.*
Awkwardness level: 1000.

## 🧠 Phase 4: The Brain Attack

The worst part of no music is that you are left alone with your own thoughts.
And your brain hates you.

**Brain:** "Hey, since we have no music, let's remember that time you waved at someone who wasn't waving at you in 2019."
**You:** "Please stop."
**Brain:** "Let's also worry about your future, your career, and global warming."

Music was the only thing keeping the demons away. Now they are having a party.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Arriving at your destination feels like returning from a war zone. You are exhausted. You are traumatized.
You vow to never make this mistake again.

**New Rule:** I am buying 3 backup pairs of earphones. One for the bag, one for the pocket, and one surgically attached to my ears.
