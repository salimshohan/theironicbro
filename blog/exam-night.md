**Category:** Student Trauma  
**Mood:** Panicked but pretending to be cool

It is currently **2:47 AM**. The world is sleeping, but you? You are questioning every life decision that led you to this moment. The ceiling fan is rotating at full speed, and so is your anxiety.

Welcome to the **"Night Before the Exam"** – the only time of the year when atheists start praying and students become philosophers.

## 📉 The "I Have Time" Paradox

The night usually starts with a lie. A beautiful, comforting lie we tell ourselves at 8:00 PM.

> **"Bro, chill. It's just 5 chapters. I'll start at 9 PM, finish by 12, and get a full 8 hours of sleep."**

### Reality Check:
* **8:00 PM:** Scrolling reels ("Just 5 minutes").
* **9:30 PM:** Dinner (Why does food taste better during exams?).
* **10:45 PM:** Calling a friend to check how much *they* studied.
* **11:30 PM:** Finally opening the book.
* **11:31 PM:** Realizing you don't even know the subject code.

## 🧮 The Midnight Mathematics

At roughly 1:00 AM, every student becomes a mathematician. Not solving calculus, but calculating the **Passing Probability**.

Here is the universal formula:
1.  **Total Chapters:** 12
2.  **Time Left:** 6 Hours
3.  **Speed Required:** 2 Chapters/Hour.

**Conclusion:** Is it possible? Physically, yes. Mentally? **Nah Bro.**

So, we switch to **Strategy B**: *The "Important Topics" Gamble.*
We text the class topper: *"Dost, suggestion de na plzz."*

## 🤡 Types of Students You Meet Tonight

On exam night, your messenger group chat turns into a zoo. Here are the species you will find:

### 1. The "I Know Nothing" Liar 🐍
* **What they say:** "Bro, I am dead. I haven't even bought the book."
* **Reality:** They have finished the syllabus 3 times and are currently revising the footnotes.
* **Result:** GPA 4.00.

### 2. The Resource Collector 📂
* They have 50 PDFs, 20 slide decks, and 10 years of question banks.
* **Problem:** They haven't opened a single one. They just like collecting files.

### 3. The Religious Convert 🙏
* Suddenly promises God to donate 500 taka to the mosque/temple if they pass this one subject.

### 4. The Legend (You) 😎
* Trying to learn 6 months of Engineering in 6 hours from a random Indian guy on YouTube.

## 🧠 The 5 Stages of Exam Grief

1.  **Denial:** "The teacher won't give questions from Chapter 7. It's too hard."
2.  **Anger:** "Why do we even need to learn this? Will mitochondria help me pay taxes?"
3.  **Bargaining:** "If I skip Chapter 3, 4, and 5, can I still get a B-?"
4.  **Depression:** Staring at the wall for 20 minutes thinking about becoming a potato farmer.
5.  **Acceptance:** "Whatever happens, happens. A single sheet of paper cannot decide my future." *(It actually can, but let's ignore that).*

## ☕ Coffee: The False Messiah

You drink coffee to stay awake.
**Expectation:** Laser focus, high energy.
**Reality:** Your heart is beating at 140 BPM, your hands are shaking, you can hear colors, but you still can't memorize the definition of "Thermodynamics".

## 🌅 The 4 AM Hallucinations

It is now dawn. The birds are chirping. Their sound is mocking you. You have covered 30% of the syllabus.

You make the ultimate decision:
> **"I will sleep for exactly 20 minutes and wake up fresh."**

**The Tragedy:** You close your eyes at 4:15 AM. You open them at 8:30 AM. The exam is at 9:00 AM.
*Panic intensifies.*

## 🏁 Final Words

To everyone reading this while procrastinating for an exam tomorrow:
**Go study.** Or at least, learn how to write confident nonsense. Because in the exam hall, confidence > knowledge.

**Good luck, Soldier.** May the force (and the person sitting in front of you) be with you.
