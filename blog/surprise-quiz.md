Classrooms are supposed to be safe spaces. We sit, we listen (mostly), and we wait for the bell.
But sometimes, teachers wake up and choose chaos.

They walk in with a specific look in their eyes. They don't say "Good Morning."
They say the six scariest words in the English language:
**"Put your books away. Surprise Quiz."**

My soul leaves my body. My stomach drops to the floor. My future flashes before my eyes.
Here is the anatomy of a Pop Quiz disaster.

## 👂 Phase 1: The Trigger Phrase

"Take out a piece of paper."

This sentence physically hurts. It is not an instruction; it is a threat.
I look around the room. Everyone has the same face of terror.
* **The Smart Kid:** Even he looks worried. If *he* is worried, I am dead.
* **The Backbenchers:** They don't even have paper. They are borrowing paper from the guy who is borrowing a pen from me.

## 🧠 Phase 2: The Memory Wipe

The teacher hands out the question paper.
I look at Question 1.
**Q1:** *"Explain the theory we discussed yesterday."*

**My Brain:** *Static Noise.*
I was there yesterday. I was physically present. But mentally? I was planning my lunch.
I remember the teacher wearing a blue shirt. I remember a fly buzzing near the window.
I do **not** remember the theory.

## ✍️ Phase 3: The "Creative Writing" Strategy

Since I don't know the answer, I have to improvise.
I cannot leave it blank. That is surrender.
So, I start writing nonsense with high-level vocabulary.

* **Actual Answer:** "Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell."
* **My Answer:** "The cell, which is a complex structure of life, has many houses. The power is very important. Therefore, the energy is generated in a location that is crucial for survival. In conclusion, yes."

I am not answering the question. I am filibustering.

## 👀 Phase 4: The Telepathic Communication

I look at my friend across the room.
We don't speak, but we have a full conversation with our eyes.

* **Me:** (Widens eyes, tilts head to the left) *"What is the answer to number 3?"*
* **Friend:** (Shrugs shoulders, looks at ceiling) *"I don't even know what subject this is."*
* **Me:** (Blinks rapidly) *"We are doomed."*

The teacher clears their throat. We immediately look down and pretend to write furiously.

## ⏱️ Phase 5: The Last Minute Panic

"Two minutes left!"

I have answered 1 out of 5 questions.
I start guessing wildly.
* **Multiple Choice:** "When in doubt, choose C."
* **True/False:** "T, F, T, T, F... looks like a good pattern."

I hand in the paper. It is wet with my sweat.

## 🏁 Conclusion

A surprise quiz is not a test of knowledge. It is a test of survival.
I walk out of the class feeling like I just survived a war zone.

**Friend:** "What did you get for question 4?"
**Me:** "There was a question 4? I thought there were only 3..."

**Grade Expectation:** F (for "Funny attempt").
