We have all done it. You feel a slight pain in your toe. Or maybe a mild headache.
A normal person would take a nap or drink some water.
But we are not normal. We are "Cyberchondriacs."

We open Google. We type: *"Left toe hurts slightly."*
And within 0.5 seconds, the internet convinces us that we have a rare, incurable disease found only in the Amazon rainforest.

Here is the timeline of a Google Medical Diagnosis.

## 🤧 Phase 1: The Symptom

It starts innocently.
**Me:** "Hmm, my throat is a little scratchy. Probably just allergies."
**Brain:** "But what if it's not? What if it's the plague? CHECK GOOGLE."

I try to resist. I know it's a trap. But my fingers are already typing.

## 🔍 Phase 2: The Search Results

**Search Query:** *"Scratchy throat symptoms"*

**Result 1 (Mayo Clinic):** "Common cold. Drink fluids."
**Me:** "Okay, that sounds reasonable."

**Result 2 (WebMD):** "Throat Cancer. Symptoms include scratchy throat."
**Me:** "Wait, what?"

**Result 3 (Random Forum User 'DragonSlayer99'):** "My cousin had a scratchy throat. Two days later? EXPLODED. RIP."

## 😱 Phase 3: The Spiral

Logic leaves the chat. Panic enters.
I start checking other "symptoms" that I didn't even have 5 minutes ago.

* "Do my elbows hurt?" (I poke my elbow). "YES! They hurt if I poke them hard enough!"
* "Is my vision blurry?" (I squint). "OMG, I can't read the text from 10 meters away! I am going blind too!"

Suddenly, I am connecting dots that don't exist. I am creating a medical conspiracy theory with my own body.

## 🏥 Phase 4: The Acceptance

I close my laptop. I lie on my bed, looking at the ceiling.
I start planning my funeral.
* "Who will get my PlayStation?"
* "I should delete my browser history before I go."

I text my mom: *"I love you. I don't have much time left."*
**Mom:** *"Did you drink water?"*
**Me:** *"No, but Google says-"*
**Mom:** *"Go drink water."*

## 💊 Phase 5: The Cure

I drink a glass of water. I take a nap.
I wake up.
The headache is gone. The throat is fine. I am alive.

**Conclusion:** It was dehydration.
**Google's Diagnosis:** Rare Tropical Fungus Infection.

## 🏁 Lesson Learned

Google is great for finding recipes or cat videos.
It is **terrible** for medical advice.

If you ask Google *"Why is my eye twitching?"*, it will never say *"You are tired."*
It will always say *"Brain Tumor."*

**Pro Tip:** If you feel sick, go to a doctor. If you go to Google, bring a will.
