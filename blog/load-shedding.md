Electricity in our country has a mind of its own. It doesn't just "go out." It waits. It watches.
It waits for you to start a **Ranked Match** in your game.
It waits for you to write 500 lines of code without saving.
It waits for you to apply shampoo in the shower.

**And then... CLICK. Darkness.**

Here is the tragic timeline of a Load Shedding victim.

## 🎮 The Gamer's Pain

You are playing Valorant/PUBG. It is the final round. It is a 1v1 clutch situation.
You are about to shoot.
**Load Shedding:** "I'm gonna stop you right there."

* **WiFi:** Gone.
* **PC:** Off.
* **Rank:** De-ranked to Iron 1.
* **Teammates:** Reporting you for "AFK".

You sit in the dark, staring at the black screen, questioning the infrastructure of the entire nation.

## 🦟 The Mosquito Air Force

Mosquitoes are smart. They know physics. They know that **Fan Speed > Mosquito Speed**.
So, they hide. They wait in the corners.

The moment the fan stops spinning, they launch a coordinated attack.
* **Target:** Your ears.
* **Sound:** *Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...*
* **Mission:** Suck your blood and ruin your mental peace.

You slap your own face in the dark trying to kill one. You miss. The mosquito laughs.

## 🌡️ The Free Sauna

Who needs a spa membership when you have load shedding in summer?
Within 2 minutes of the power cut, your room turns into an oven.
You are sweating in places you didn't know could sweat.

You grab a book (or a piece of cardboard) and start fanning yourself manually.
**Result:** Your hand gets tired, you sweat more, and the room gets hotter. Thermodynamics is cruel.

## 🔋 The UPS/IPS Betrayal

You bought a UPS to save your PC. You bought an IPS to save your sleep.
But batteries have trust issues.

**Normal Day:** "I am fully charged!"
**Load Shedding Starts:**
* **UPS:** *Beeeeep... Beep...* (Dies in 2 minutes).
* **You:** "You had ONE job!"

## 🏁 Conclusion

Load shedding teaches us patience. It teaches us to appreciate the little things (like a working fan).
But mostly, it teaches us how to hunt mosquitoes in pitch darkness using only sound.

**Current Status:** Waiting for the "Ding!" sound of the electricity returning.
