The car is not just a vehicle. It is a sanctuary. It is a soundproof booth. It is the only place on Earth where I am totally convinced that I have the voice of an angel.

When I am outside, I am a normal, functioning member of society. I speak at a reasonable volume. I have social anxiety.

But the moment that car door closes and the Bluetooth connects, a transformation happens. I am no longer a regular person. I am Beyoncé at Coachella. I am Freddie Mercury at Live Aid.

This is the reality of being a superstar... entirely in your own head.

## 🎤 The Delusion: Inside the Cabin

In my head, the acoustics of my 2010 Toyota Corolla rival the Sydney Opera House.

When my favorite sad song comes on, I don't just sing the lyrics; I *feel* them in my soul. I am hitting notes that don't even exist on a standard piano. My vibrato is flawless. My emotional delivery would make grown men cry.

I am performing hand gestures. I am looking out the window dramatically like I'm in a mid-2000s music video. I am ready for my world tour. I genuinely wonder why musical talent scouts haven't found me yet.

## 🚦 The Reality Check: The Red Light Incident

There is no moment more humbling in human existence than the "Stoplight Reality Check."

 Picture this:
You are screaming the bridge of a Taylor Swift song. Your eyes are closed. You are emotionally devastated by the lyrics. You are giving the performance of a lifetime.

Then, you open your eyes. The car has stopped at a red light.
You look to your left.

The driver in the car next to you is staring directly at you.

They aren't looking at you with admiration. They look terrified. They look confused. They think you are having a medical emergency or perhaps being attacked by an invisible bee.

You immediately stop singing, slowly roll up your window, fix your hair, and stare straight ahead at the traffic light, pretending you were just yawning very aggressively.

## 🎧 The Genre Crisis

My car personality changes drastically depending on the playlist shuffle.

* **Rap Music:** Suddenly, I think I am Eminem. I miss 95% of the words in the fast verse, mumbling incoherently, but I shout the one swear word I know with absolute confidence.
* **Rock Music:** I am playing the air guitar on the steering wheel so hard I almost change lanes accidentally.
* **High School Throwbacks:** I am unlocking core memories and screaming lyrics I haven't heard in 10 years, sounding like a distressed goat.

## 📼 The Accidental Recording

The ultimate proof that we are delusional is hearing a recording of ourselves.

Sometimes, I accidentally send a voice note while driving and singing. Playing it back later is pure trauma.

It doesn't sound like Adele. It sounds like two cats fighting inside a blender. It sounds like a dying seal begging for mercy. It is off-key, too loud, and deeply disturbing.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Will the reality check stop me? Absolutely not.

Singing in the car is free therapy. It is stress relief. It is essential for my mental health.

So, to the people in the car next to me at the traffic light: I am sorry for what you have to see and hear. But the show must go on.

**Next Track:** "I Will Always Love You" (Prepare your ears).
