Time is relative. Einstein said it, but students *live* it.
When you are in a boring lecture, 5 minutes feels like 5 years.
When you have an assignment due, 5 days feels like 5 seconds.

We all suffer from a chronic condition called **"Future Me Syndrome."**
We believe that "Future Me" will be smarter, faster, and more energetic.
Spoiler Alert: "Future Me" is just as lazy as "Present Me," but with more panic.

Here is the lifecycle of the Time Paradox.

## 🗓️ Phase 1: The "Ages Away" (2 Weeks Left)

The teacher assigns the project. The deadline is in 14 days.
**Brain:** "14 days? That is basically a lifetime. You could learn a new language, build a house, and still have time to finish this assignment."

**Action:** You open the document. You write the title. You change the font to something cool. You close the document.
**Status:** "I have started. I am responsible." (Lie).

## 🌤️ Phase 2: The False Comfort (1 Week Left)

Seven days remain.
**Brain:** "One week is plenty. If I do a little bit every day, I will be done in no time."

**Action:** You do absolutely nothing. You watch three seasons of a show you have already seen. You clean your room. You reorganize your playlist.
**Logic:** "I work better under pressure anyway."

## ⚠️ Phase 3: The Realization (2 Days Left)

Suddenly, it is Wednesday. The assignment is due Friday.
The panic starts to simmer.
**Brain:** "Okay, playtime is over. We need to focus."

**Action:** You sit down to work. But first, you need snacks. And coffee. And you need to check your email. And water the plants.
You spend 4 hours *preparing* to work, but 0 minutes actually working.

## 🚨 Phase 4: The Speed Run (The Night Before)

It is 10 PM. The assignment is due at 8 AM.
The Time Paradox hits its peak. The clock is moving faster than physically possible.

You transform into a machine.
* **Typing Speed:** 500 words per minute.
* **Quality Control:** Non-existent.
* **Citations:** "Source: Trust me bro."

You are fueled by caffeine and pure terror. You are writing nonsense, but it looks professional.

## 🏁 Conclusion

You submit the assignment at 7:59 AM.
You promised yourself: *"Never again. Next time, I will start early."*

**The Truth:** You will absolutely do it again next time.
Because why do today what you can panic about tomorrow?
