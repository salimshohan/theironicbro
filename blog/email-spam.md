Once upon a time, my email inbox was a sacred place. It was for important things: job applications, university results, and messages from actual human beings.

Today, my inbox is a chaotic marketplace where 500 different companies are screaming at me to buy things I don't need, with money I don't have.

I have 3,457 unread emails. 3,450 of them are "exclusive offers" extending my car warranty for a car I don't even own.

This is the chronicle of my endless, losing battle against SPAM.

## 🛒 The Origin Story: The Mistake of 2019

It all started five years ago. I bought **one** pair of socks online from a random website.
To get a 5% discount, I committed the ultimate sin: **I gave them my email address.**

That was the beginning of the end.
Since that fateful day, this sock company believes we are in a committed relationship. They email me every morning.

> **Subject:** "We Miss You! Come Back!"
> **Me:** Bro, I just bought socks. I didn't sign up for a lifetime subscription to your emotional baggage.

## 🕵️‍♂️ The Hunt for the "Unsubscribe" Button

Deciding to leave an email list is easy. Actually leaving it is an Olympic sport.

Companies hide the "Unsubscribe" button like it's a national treasure.
* It’s usually at the very bottom of a 10-page email.
* It’s written in size 4 font.
* The text color is light grey, against a white background.

It’s like playing "Where's Waldo," but for regaining your sanity.

## 🥺 The Emotional Guilt Trip

When you finally find the tiny button and click it, they don't just let you go. Oh no. They take you to a webpage designed to make you feel like a terrible person.

You see a picture of a sad puppy or a crying cartoon character.
> **Website:** "Are you sure you want to leave us? Think of the good times! If you leave, our mascot 'Mr. Fluffles' will cry."

**Me:** I DON'T CARE ABOUT MR. FLUFFLES. LET ME OUT.

Then they offer you options:
* [ ] Instead of leaving, how about fewer emails?
* [ ] How about weekly emails?
* [x] **DELETE ME FROM EXISTENCE.**

## 🧟 The Zombie Newsletter

The biggest lie in the digital world is this sentence:
> *"Please allow 7-10 business days for your request to be processed."*

**Why?** Are you sending a carrier pigeon to update your database? It’s 2026! It should take 0.5 seconds!

You unsubscribe on Monday. By Friday, they send you:
> **Subject:** "One Last Chance! 20% Off!"

You cannot kill what is already dead. These emails are zombies.

## 🗑️ The Final Solution

I have given up trying to be civil. I no longer look for the unsubscribe button.
I have embraced the nuclear option.

I select all. I click **"Mark as Spam"**.
I watch them disappear into the digital void. It feels incredibly satisfying for exactly 5 minutes.

Until tomorrow morning, when 50 new emails arrive from companies I've never heard of.

**Current Inbox Status:** 99+ New Notifications.
**Plan for the day:** Select All -> Delete.
