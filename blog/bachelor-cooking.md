Cooking shows make it look so easy. A pinch of salt, a splash of olive oil, and *voila*—a gourmet meal.
But for a bachelor living alone, cooking is not an art. It is a **Survival Mission**.

We don't cook for taste. We cook so we don't die of starvation.

Here is the reality of the "Bachelor Kitchen".

## 🥚 The Holy Grail: Eggs

If chickens ever decide to go on strike, 90% of bachelors will starve to death within a week.
The egg is our savior.

* **Breakfast:** Omelet.
* **Lunch:** Boiled Egg.
* **Dinner:** Scrambled Egg (It was supposed to be an omelet, but I failed to flip it).

We have discovered 101 ways to cook an egg, and 100 of them involve burning the pan.

## 🍝 The "2-Minute" Noodle Scam

Instant noodles are the backbone of our economy. But let's be honest, it never takes 2 minutes.

1.  Boil water (5 mins).
2.  Add noodles.
3.   realize you ran out of the tastemaker packet.
4.  Eat tasteless, soggy worms with sadness.

**Pro Tip:** Adding a slice of cheese to instant noodles makes you feel like an Italian Chef. (It doesn't taste better, but it feels expensive).

## 🍽️ The Dishwashing Nightmare

The worst part of cooking isn't the cooking. It's the **Dishes**.
Cooking takes 15 minutes. Eating takes 5 minutes. Looking at the pile of dirty dishes takes 3 business days.

**Bachelor Logic:**
* Why use a plate? Eat directly from the frying pan.
* Why use a spoon? Use the same fork you used to mix the eggs.
* Why wash the cup? Just rinse it with water; coffee kills germs, right?

## 🗑️ The Mystery Tupperware

Open a bachelor's fridge, and you will find a Tupperware box in the back.
No one knows what is inside. It has been there since 2024.
It might be rice, it might be a new biological weapon. We are too scared to open it.

## 🏁 Conclusion

To all the mothers out there: **We are sorry.**
We took your cooking for granted. We thought it was easy. We were wrong.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go scrape the burnt toast off my pan.

**Dinner Plan:** Ordering Pizza. Again.
