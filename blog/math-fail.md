There was a time when Math was beautiful.
1 + 1 = 2.
5 x 5 = 25.
It made sense. It was logical. We were happy.

But then, something terrible happened. The numbers started disappearing.
They were replaced by letters. Then by Greek symbols. Then by shapes that look like squashed snakes.

Now, I sit in Math class not calculating numbers, but translating an ancient alien language.

Here is the breakdown of my daily struggle in the war against Calculus.

## ⏳ The "5-Second" Blink Rule

Math class requires 100% constant visual contact.
If you look away for even 5 seconds, you are doomed.

* **09:00 AM:** The teacher writes `2x + y = 10`. Okay, I get this. Easy.
* **09:00:05 AM:** I drop my pen. I bend down to pick it up.
* **09:00:10 AM:** I look back at the board.

The board is now covered in hieroglyphics. There are brackets inside brackets. There is a symbol that looks like a pitchfork. The teacher is drawing a 3D graph.
**Me:** "What happened? Did I travel forward in time? How did we get here?"

## 🔡 The Alphabet Invasion

Why are there so many letters?
I thought this was Mathematics, not English Literature.

* "Find x." (He is gone, move on).
* "Find y." (Why not?)
* "Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Theta, Lambda."

At this point, I am not solving equations; I am just learning the Greek alphabet against my will.
When the answer to a math problem is a sentence instead of a number, you know society has failed.

## 🧙‍♂️ The "Obviously" Trap

The most painful moment is when the teacher skips 5 steps and says:
> *"From this step, it is obviously clear that the equation simplifies to zero."*

**Me:** "Obviously? To whom? To Einstein? Because to me, it looks like dark magic."

I look around the class. Everyone is nodding.
Are they geniuses? Or are they pretending too?
I nod slowly, pretending I understand, while internally screaming.

## 🎨 Art Class in Disguise

Eventually, I stop trying to understand. I switch to "Copy Mode."
I don't know what I am writing. I am just drawing the shapes the teacher draws.

* He draws a squiggle? **I draw a squiggle.**
* He draws a triangle? **I draw a triangle.**

If the teacher accidentally sneezed and drew a line on the board, I would copy that too. My notebook is just a collection of meaningless artistic symbols.

## 🏁 Conclusion

I have accepted that I will never use `(a+b)^2` in real life.
I go to the grocery store.
**Cashier:** "That will be $50."
**Me:** "Let me calculate the trajectory of the coin using the Pythagorean theorem."

No. I will use a calculator. Or I will cry. Probably both.

**Current Status:** Waiting for the bell to ring so I can escape.
