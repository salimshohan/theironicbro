Result day is not scary because of the grades. We know we messed up; we accepted that fate weeks ago.
Result day is scary because of **The Relatives**.

There is a special species of relatives who hibernate for 364 days a year. They don't call you on your birthday. They don't call when you are sick.
But the moment—the *exact second*—the result is published, their telepathic sensors activate.

Here is the breakdown of the psychological warfare known as "Relatives vs. GPA."

---

## 🕵️ Phase 1: The Radar Activation

The result isn't even online yet. The server is crashing. You are refreshing the page with shaking hands.
Suddenly, your mother’s phone rings.

You freeze. You know who it is.
It is **Aunt Karen** (or whatever her name is). She lives three cities away. You haven't spoken to her since 2019. But today? Today she is very concerned about your academic future.

**Mom:** "Oh, hello! Yes, results are out today..."
**You (whispering):** *Tell her I died. Tell her I ran away to the forest.*

## 💣 Phase 2: The Direct Attack

Your mom hands you the phone. There is no escape.

**Aunt:** "Hello dear! How are you?"
**You:** "I'm fi-"
**Aunt:** "CUT THE CRAP. WHAT IS THE GPA?"

She doesn't care about your health. She doesn't care about your life. She just wants a number. A number she can use to destroy her own son's happiness later.

## 📉 Phase 3: The Comparison Trap

You mutter your GPA. Let's say it's a decent **3.5**.
You are happy. Your parents are okay with it.
But Aunt? Aunt is not impressed.

**Aunt:** "Oh... 3.5? That's... nice." (The tone suggests it is actually trash).
**Aunt:** "You know, my neighbor's sister's driver's son got a 4.00. And he studies by street light."

Comparison is the thief of joy, and relatives are the thieves of sanity. They will always find someone better than you, even if they have to invent a fictional cousin named "Rahul" who is an astronaut at age 12.

## 🧠 Phase 4: The Unsolicited Advice

After destroying your confidence, they proceed to give career advice based on zero knowledge.

**Aunt:** "I think you spend too much time on that mobile phone. You should wake up at 4 AM and drink hot water. That increases GPA."

**You:** "Auntie, I study Computer Science. Hot water won't help me debug code."
**Aunt:** "Don't argue. I have seen life."

---

## 🍬 Phase 5: The "Sweets" Protocol

If you actually get a good result (miraculously), the problem changes.
Now they want **Sweets**.

**Aunt:** "Wow! A+! When are you sending sweets?"
**You:** "Auntie, I am broke."
**Aunt:** "No excuses! We need a party!"

Basically, if you fail, you get roasted. If you pass, you go bankrupt buying food for people who secretly wanted you to fail.

## 🛡️ Survival Guide for Students

If you have results coming up soon, here is a strategic plan:

1.  **The Blackout:** Turn off your phone. Turn off your parents' phones. Cut the landline wire.
2.  **The Fake ID:** If they ask, tell them the server crashed and wiped everyone's data.
3.  **The Offensive:** Before they ask your GPA, ask them about their son's salary or their daughter's marriage. Watch them hang up instantly.

## 🏁 Conclusion

To all the relatives reading this:
We love you, but please, get a hobby. Go gardening. Watch a soap opera. Leave our GPAs alone.

To the students:
Your grades do not define you. But your ability to tolerate annoying phone calls defines your patience. Stay strong.

**Incoming Call...** *Declined.*
