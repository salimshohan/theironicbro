There are three things in life that are certain: Death, Taxes, and **Slow Internet** right when you need it the most.

We live in a world of 5G, fiber optics, and Elon Musk's Starlink. Yet, somehow, my internet speed is powered by a hamster running on a wheel. And I think the hamster just died.

Here is the tragedy of living life in 144p resolution.

## ⏳ The 99% Curse

You are downloading a 5GB file. It moves fast.
* 50%... (Smooth)
* 80%... (Looking good)
* 99%... (Almost there!)

**And then it stops.**
It stays at 99% for 5 minutes. Then 10 minutes. Then it says: **"Download Failed. Network Error."**

At this moment, throwing the laptop out of the window is not anger; it is a logical reaction.

> **Fun Fact:** The last 1% of a download takes longer than the entire history of the universe.

## 🎮 The Gaming Lag (Ping: 999+)

You are playing an online game. You are about to shoot the enemy. You are winning.
Suddenly, your character stops moving. The enemy is running in place like Michael Jackson.

**You:** "Hello? Can anyone hear me?"
**Game:** *Disconnecting from server.*

When the internet comes back, you are already dead, your team has reported you, and you have lost 50 rank points.
**Reason:** Your mom turned on the microwave in the kitchen.

## 📝 The 11:59 PM Submission

It is 11:55 PM. The assignment deadline is 11:59 PM.
You have finished writing. You click **"Upload"**.

**Internet:** "I don't think so."
The blue bar moves... slowly... so slowly.

* **11:57 PM:** Uploading...
* **11:58 PM:** Still Uploading...
* **11:59 PM:** *Connection Lost.*

**12:00 AM:** *Upload Complete.* (LATE SUBMISSION).
Congratulations, you just failed the semester because of a wire bitten by a rat somewhere under the ocean.

## 📹 The Video Call Freeze

You are in an online class or a video call with your crush.
The internet is fine when you are silent.
But the moment you make a weird face or open your mouth to sneeze—**FREEZE.**

The screen freezes exactly when you look like a demon possession victim. And it stays like that for 10 seconds for everyone to see.

**Teacher:** "Is he okay? He looks like he is in pain."
**You:** (Still frozen with mouth open).

## 🦖 The Only Good Thing: Chrome Dinosaur

When the internet dies, there is only one hero who stands by us. **The Chrome Dinosaur.**

I have played this game more than GTA V.
My high score in the Dinosaur game is higher than my bank balance. It is the only time I feel successful in life.

## 🏁 Conclusion

To the ISPs (Internet Service Providers):
We don't want the moon. We just want to watch a YouTube video without it pausing every 3 seconds to show us the loading circle.

Until then, I will stare at this loading screen and think about the meaning of life.

**Buffering...**
