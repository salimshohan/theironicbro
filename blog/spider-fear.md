There is a simple rule of nature: If I can see the spider, we are cool. I mean, I am terrified, but at least I know where the enemy is.

But the moment the spider disappears? **Panic.**

I am a grown adult. I pay taxes. I have a job. But if I lose visual contact with a spider in my bedroom at 11 PM, I am legally required to burn the house down and move to another country.

Here is the timeline of the "Spider Incident".

## 👁️ Phase 1: Contact

You are relaxing in your room. Suddenly, you see movement in the corner.
It is a spider.
And not just any spider. In your eyes, it is not a tiny insect; it is Aragog from Harry Potter. It has huge hairy legs and is looking at you with malicious intent.

**Strategy:**
"Okay, stay calm. Keep your eyes on the target. Do not blink. Reach for the slipper."

## 🏃 Phase 2: The Fatal Mistake

You turn your head for **0.5 seconds** to grab a shoe, a broom, or a bottle of bug spray.
You turn back to the corner, ready for battle.

**The wall is empty.**

The spider is gone.
It didn't walk away. It didn't crawl away. It *teleported*. It used ninja smoke bombs and vanished into the shadows.

## 😱 Phase 3: The Paranoia

This is where the psychological torture begins.
Since you don't know where it is, logic dictates that it could be **anywhere**.

* Is it on the ceiling, waiting to drop on my face like Mission Impossible?
* Is it under my pillow?
* Is it currently crawling up my leg? (You slap your leg just to be safe).

Every itch feels like a bite. Every shadow looks like a leg. You are now fighting an invisible enemy.

## 🛌 Phase 4: The Eviction

You realize you cannot sleep in this room tonight. The room belongs to the spider now. He is the Captain now.

You grab your blanket (shaking it violently first) and move to the living room couch.
You sleep with one eye open.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Spiders are nature's reminder that we are not in control.
We built cities, went to the moon, and created the internet.
But one tiny arachnid can make a grown human stand on top of a chair screaming for help.

**Current Status:** Sleeping in the hallway until further notice.
