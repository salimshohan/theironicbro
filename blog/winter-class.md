There are many forms of torture in this world. There is walking on Lego bricks, there is listening to a baby cry on a flight, and then there is the ultimate punishment: **The 8:00 AM Class in January.**

If you have ever left your blanket on a foggy winter morning to attend a lecture on "Calculus," you are not a student. You are a **War Hero**.

Here is the timeline of this daily tragedy.

## ⏰ 7:00 AM: The Alarm of Death

Your phone rings. It’s not just a ringtone; it’s the sound of your dreams shattering.
Outside, it is pitch black. The sun hasn't even woken up yet. Even the birds are sleeping.

**Your Brain:** "It's still night. Go back to sleep."
**Your Phone:** "WAKE UP OR YOU WILL FAIL THE COURSE."

You hit **Snooze**.
*7:05 AM.* Snooze.
*7:10 AM.* Snooze.
*7:30 AM.* **PANIC.**

## 🛌 The Physics of the Blanket

In winter, the blanket follows a special law of physics known as **"The Gravitational Pull of Comfort."**
The temperature inside the blanket is warm, cozy, and safe. The temperature outside involves potential hypothermia.

Leaving the blanket feels like peeling your own skin off. You try to stick one leg out to test the temperature.
**Result:** The leg freezes instantly. You pull it back.

> **Internal Debate:**
> "Do I *really* need this degree? Maybe I can become a potato farmer. Potatoes don't have 8 AM classes."

## 🚿 7:45 AM: The Bathroom Challenge

You finally gather the courage to leave the bed. Your feet touch the floor.
**THE FLOOR IS LAVA.** (Except the lava is made of ice).

You hop towards the bathroom. You look at the tap water.
In summer, water is life. In winter, tap water is **Liquid Nitrogen**.

Washing your face in winter requires the bravery of a Spartan soldier. You splash water on your face, and your soul leaves your body for 3 seconds.
Shower? **Nah Bro.** That’s a weekend activity. Deodorant is the shower of winter.

## 🌫️ 8:15 AM: The Expedition (Commute)

You are late. You step outside.
You can’t see anything. The fog is thicker than your textbook.
Is that a bus? Is that a rickshaw? Is that a White Walker from Game of Thrones? Who knows.

The rickshaw puller is wearing a monkey cap. You are wearing 3 hoodies. You look like a walking onion.
The wind hits your face. It feels like tiny knives. Your nose turns red. Your ears go numb. You question every life choice that led you to this university.

## 🏫 8:40 AM: The Classroom of Zombies

You arrive 40 minutes late. The teacher doesn't care. The teacher is also regretting their life choices.

You look around the class:
* **The Backbenchers:** Sleeping with eyes open.
* **The Topper:** Taking notes with shivering hands.
* **The Couple:** Sharing one hoodie (Cringe, but warm).

The fan is OFF, but the room is still a refrigerator. The metal benches suck the heat out of your body.
You try to hold your pen. Your fingers are frozen. You write "Date: Jan 19" and give up.

**What you learned today:** Absolutely nothing.
**Attendance:** Present. (Mission Accomplished).

## 🏁 Conclusion

To the authorities who schedule classes at 8 AM in winter: **Why?**
Who hurt you?

If you made it to class today, treat yourself to a hot tea. You survived.
And if you skipped class and are reading this from inside your blanket...
**You made the right choice.**

Stay warm, legends.
