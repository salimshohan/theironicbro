Every class has one. The villain. The traitor. The one who smiles too much at the professor.
We call them the **"Chatu Friend"** (The Teacher's Pet).

Their existence has only one purpose: **To ruin the lives of backbenchers.**

Here is a breakdown of their crimes against student humanity.

## ⏰ The 11:59 AM Betrayal

The class is about to end. The bell is ringing.
The teacher has forgotten about the homework assignment.
Everyone is packing their bags. Freedom is 10 seconds away.

**And then... HE speaks.**

> **Chatu:** "Sir, what about the assignment you gave last week?"

**The Class:** 👁️👄👁️
**The Teacher:** "Oh yes! Thank you for reminding me! Everyone, submit it now."

At this exact moment, 49 students unite mentally to plan a murder. If looks could kill, that guy would be ashes.

## 📋 Distinct Features of a Chatu

How to identify them in the wild? Look for these signs:

1.  **Front Bench Permanent Resident:** They don't just sit in the front; they practically sit on the teacher's desk.
2.  **The "Duster" Duty:** They run to clean the board before the CR can even stand up.
3.  **Laughs at Bad Jokes:**
    * **Teacher:** *Cracks a terrible joke from 1985.*
    * **Class:** *Dead silence.*
    * **Chatu:** "HAHAHA SIR YOU ARE SO FUNNY!"

## 🎒 The "Bag Carrier" Syndrome

You will see them walking with the teacher from the staff room to the classroom, carrying the teacher's laptop bag.
**Why?** Are they getting paid? No.
They are paid in **"Internal Marks."**

While we struggle to get a passing grade, they walk out with an A+ just because they know the teacher's favorite color.

## 🧠 The Question After Class

The lecture is over. We want to leave.
But the Chatu friend stops the teacher at the door.

**Chatu:** "Sir, I had a doubt regarding page 42, paragraph 3, line 6..."

This delays the teacher's exit, which delays the next teacher's entry, which ruins our break time.
**Bro, just Google it.** Let us go eat.

## 🏁 Conclusion

To all the "Teacher's Pets" reading this:
We know you want good grades. But remember, the teacher won't save you when you need a proxy attendance. We will.

**Stop reminding the teacher about the quiz, or you will be kicked out of the WhatsApp group.**

Sincerely,
The Backbenchers Association.
