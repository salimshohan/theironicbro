**Date:** Jan 22, 2026  
**Motivation:** Washed Away  
**Comfort Level:** Maximum

There is a direct scientific correlation between precipitation and my will to live (or study).
When the sun is shining, I am a responsible student. I go to class. I take notes.
But the moment water falls from the sky? **System Failure.**

My brain interprets a light drizzle not as "weather," but as a "National Emergency."
* **Reality:** It is raining slightly. You might need an umbrella.
* **My Brain:** "THIS IS THE TITANIC. THE ROADS ARE RIVERS. STAY IN BED OR YOU WILL PERISH."

Here is the logic behind skipping class on a rainy day.

## 🛌 Phase 1: The Sound of Freedom

You wake up. You hear it. *Pitter-patter.*
It is the most beautiful sound in the world. It is the sound of cancellation.

Usually, waking up for an 8 AM class is painful.
But on a rainy day, you don't wake up in panic. You wake up, smile, wrap the blanket tighter around yourself, and accept that your day has just turned into a "Bed Rotting" session.

**The Physics of Rain:** When it rains, the gravitational pull of the bed increases by 500%. It is physically impossible to stand up.

## 🌧️ Phase 2: The Window Check

You need to verify the severity of the storm to justify your laziness.
You walk to the window.

* **Scenario A:** It is a thunderstorm.
    * **Verdict:** Absolutely not going. Valid excuse.
* **Scenario B:** It is just drizzling.
    * **Verdict:** Still not going. "What if it gets worse? I can't risk it. I am made of sugar; I might melt."

I will look at a puddle on the road and convince myself it is a flood risk. "I don't have a boat, so I can't go to Calculus."

## 📱 Phase 3: The Group Chat Confirmation

You cannot skip alone. You need moral support.
You text the squad: *"Guys, it's raining pretty hard... are we going?"*

You are praying for that one friend to say "No."
* **Friend 1:** "I'm already on the bus." (Traitor).
* **Friend 2:** "Yeah, I'm skipping." (Hero).
* **Me:** "Okay, if Mike is skipping, I am skipping too. We stand united."

This is called the **Domino Effect of Laziness.**

## 🚌 Phase 4: The Commute Nightmare

Let's imagine you *do* decide to go. (Why?)
Commuting in the rain is a gladiator sport.

1.  **The Splash Zone:** Cars drive by and splash dirty water on your favorite pants.
2.  **The Umbrella War:** Walking on the sidewalk is a battle of umbrellas. You are constantly dodging spikes to protect your eyes.
3.  **The Humidity:** By the time you reach class, you are wet, your hair is frizzy, and your shoes make a *squeak-squeak* sound.

You sit in class, shivering, wondering why you didn't just stay in bed like a smart person.

## ☕ Phase 5: The Khichuri/Coffee Craving

Rainy days are not for algebra. They are for snacks.
It is biologically required to eat something warm when it rains.
* **In South Asia:** Khichuri and fried beef.
* **In the West:** Hot chocolate and cookies.

If I go to class, I get equations.
If I stay home, I get food.
The choice is obvious.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Attendance marks are temporary. The comfort of a warm blanket on a rainy morning is forever.
I will email the professor later.

**Subject:** "Absent due to severe weather conditions."
**(Actual condition: It was cloudy and I was sleepy).**
