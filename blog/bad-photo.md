There is a conspiracy against me. I am convinced of it.
In the mirror, I look decent. I look like a functioning human being.
But the moment a camera lens points in my direction, something terrible happens. My face malfunctions.

In every group photo, there are three types of people:
1.  The Model (Looks perfect from every angle).
2.  The Normal Person (Looks like themselves).
3.  **Me (Looks like a confused potato that just woke up).**

Here is the scientific breakdown of why I am banned from family albums.

## 👁️ The Blink Superpower

I have a talent. It is a useless talent, but it is impressive.
I can keep my eyes open for 5 minutes straight. But the **exact nanosecond** the shutter clicks, I blink.

It happens every time.
* **Photographer:** "3... 2... 1..."
* **Everyone else:** *Beautiful smiles.*
* **Me:** *Looks like I am possessed by a demon.*

If you scroll through my gallery, 90% of the photos look like I am sleeping standing up.

## 🗣️ The "Mid-Sentence" Disaster

If I am not blinking, I am talking.
I don't know why I choose the moment of the photo to ask a question, but I do.

* **Friend:** "Say Cheese!"
* **Me:** "Wait, is the flash o—" *CLICK.*

**Result:** Everyone looks happy. I look like I am screaming in agony with my mouth twisted in a weird shape. I look like I am eating an invisible burger.

## 🦒 The Height Struggle

Where do I stand?
If I stand in the front, my face looks huge because of the lens distortion.
If I stand in the back, I have to stand on my tiptoes to be seen.

Usually, I end up in the awkward middle ground where only half of my face is visible behind someone's shoulder. I look like a creepy stalker photobombing my own friends.

## 🤳 The "Just One More" Lie

The most painful part of group photos is the loop.

**Friend:** "Oh, let's take one more! Sarah's eyes were closed."
**Me:** "Okay." *Smites perfectly.*
**Friend:** "One more! John wasn't looking."
**Me:** "Okay." *Smiles again.*
**Friend:** "Last one! The lighting was bad."

By the 15th photo, my smile is no longer real. It is a grimace of pain. My facial muscles are twitching. I look like a serial killer trying to blend in with society.

## 🏷️ The Tagging Nightmare

The horror doesn't end when the photo is taken. It ends when it is posted online.
You get that notification:
> *"Friend has tagged you in a photo."*

Your heart stops. You open it slowly.
**It is the worst photo of you in existence.**
But your friend looks great, so they captioned it: *"Best night ever with the squad! ❤️"*

You cannot ask them to delete it because you don't want to be *that* person. So you just remove the tag and cry silently.

## 🏁 Conclusion

I have accepted my fate. I am the "Designated Photographer" now.
If I take the photo, I cannot be *in* the photo.
It is a sacrifice I am willing to make for the good of humanity (and my reputation).

**Pro Tip:** Wear sunglasses. At least then no one knows you are blinking.
