It is 3:00 AM.
The room is dark. The bed is comfortable. The temperature is perfect.
My body is ready to sleep. My eyes are heavy.

But my Brain? Oh no. My Brain has just clocked in for its night shift.
**Brain:** "Hello! Welcome to the 'Greatest Hits of Your Failures' Marathon! Grab some popcorn, we are going to be here all night."

Here is the schedule of tonight's mental torture.

## 🎬 Episode 1: The "You Too" Incident (2018)

**Brain:** "Hey, remember that time the waiter said 'Enjoy your meal'?"
**Me:** "Please, no. I am trying to sleep."
**Brain:** "And remember what you replied?"
**Me:** "I said... 'You too'."

**CRINGE.**
I stare at the ceiling.
Why did I say that? The waiter doesn't have a meal! He is working! He probably went to the kitchen and laughed at me with the chef.
I roll over. The pillow is now hot with shame.

## 🗣️ Episode 2: The Hypothetical Argument

Now that I am awake, my brain decides to rewrite history.
Remember that argument I lost 3 years ago?
**Brain:** "You know what you *should* have said? You should have said: 'Well, actually, the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell!'"

**Me:** "Wow! That is a sick comeback! I would have destroyed him!"

I then spend the next 45 minutes winning an imaginary argument against a person I haven't seen since high school. In my head, I am a genius debater. In reality, I am just drooling on my pillow.

## 🌊 Episode 3: The Wave

**Brain:** "Remember when you waved at that person in the hallway?"
**Me:** "Yeah, it was my friend."
**Brain:** "No. It wasn't. They were waving at the person *behind* you."
**Me:** "Stop it."
**Brain:** "You waved at a stranger. They looked at you like you were crazy. You slowly turned your wave into a hair scratch. But they saw. Everyone saw."

I pull the blanket over my head. I want to disappear.

## 🧮 Episode 4: The Sleep Math

It is now 4:30 AM.
I start doing the most stressful math in the world.

* "If I fall asleep right **NOW**, I will get 3 hours and 30 minutes of sleep."
* (5 minutes later)
* "If I fall asleep **NOW**, I will get 3 hours and 25 minutes."

This countdown does not help me sleep. It just makes me panic.
I try to count sheep. The sheep are judging me for the "You Too" incident.

## 🏁 Conclusion

At 6:59 AM, my brain finally gets tired.
**Brain:** "Okay, good show everyone. Let's sleep."
**Alarm Clock:** *BEEP BEEP BEEP (7:00 AM)*

I wake up looking like a zombie.
**Me:** "I hate you, Brain."
**Brain:** "Love you too! See you tonight for 'Episode 5: That Time Your Voice Cracked During a Presentation'."
