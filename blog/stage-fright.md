There is a famous study that says people fear public speaking more than they fear death.
This means that at a funeral, most people would rather be the guy *in* the coffin than the guy giving the eulogy.

I am one of those people.
The moment a teacher or boss says, *"You have to give a presentation,"* my soul leaves my body. My brain shuts down. My sweat glands go into overdrive.

Here is the anatomy of a public speaking disaster.

## 💓 Phase 1: The Waiting Game

The worst part isn't the speaking; it's the **waiting**.
You are sitting in your chair, watching others go before you.

* **Speaker 1:** Perfect confidence. Funny jokes. Great slides.
* **Speaker 2:** TED Talk level charisma.
* **Me:** Slowly hyperventilating in the corner.

My heart beats so loud I am convinced the person next to me can hear it. It sounds like a drum solo at a heavy metal concert.

## 🦵 Phase 2: The Jelly Legs

It is your turn. You stand up.
Suddenly, you realize your legs have stopped working.
They are shaking. Violently.

I don't just walk to the podium; I vibrate to the podium.
If you look closely, it looks like I am doing a very subtle Elvis Presley dance move. I try to hide behind the desk, but the desk is transparent. There is nowhere to hide.

## 🗣️ Phase 3: The Voice Betrayal

I open my mouth to say, *"Good Morning, everyone."*
In my head, I sound like Morgan Freeman.
In reality, I sound like a puberty-stricken teenager whose voice just cracked three times in one syllable.

**Me:** *"Goo-HACK-ood Morn-SQUEAK-ing."*

I clear my throat. I try again. Now I sound like a robot running out of battery.
The audience stares. I stare back. The silence is deafening.

## 📄 Phase 4: The Slide Reading

We all know the Golden Rule of PowerPoint: **"Do not read off the slides."**
But when panic sets in, my brain deletes all memories.

I turn my back to the audience and start reading every single word on the screen.
* **Slide:** "The Q4 earnings were high."
* **Me:** "The... letter... Q... number... 4... earnings... were... high."

I am not presenting; I am just proving to the audience that I know how to read English.

## 🥵 Phase 5: The Q&A Trap

You finish. You survive. You are about to run back to your seat.
Then, the teacher says: *"Any questions?"*

**NO.** Please, no questions. Just let me leave.
Someone raises their hand. They ask a complex question about the data.

**My Brain:** *White noise.*
**My Mouth:** "That is a great question. The answer is... um... the thing... because of the... yes. Thank you."

I have no idea what I just said. They have no idea what I just said. But I sit down immediately.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Public speaking is not a skill; it is a torture method.
I would rather fight a bear than hold a microphone in front of 50 people.

**Note to self:** Next time, pretend to have lost my voice. Sign language presentation.
